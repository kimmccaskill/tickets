# TicketCloud
### Application for seeing when the best events go on sale

## Solo project by Kim McCaskill, Module 3 at Turing School of Software and Design

### Learning Goals:

  - Reinforce React fundamentals
  - Reinforce using React Router to create a multi-page user experience
  - Reinforce component and asynchronous JS testing
  - Work with and navigate a shared, persistent API using GET, POST, and DELETE requests
  - Implement Redux as the appâ€™s place to store shared state
  - Test Redux functions

#### Wins:
- Successfully diving into TicketMaster API docs to create a helpful app for my own benefit as well as friends.
  
#### Challenges
- First major API not built by instructors led to unfamiliar documentation and challenges navigating data.

### Overview of Site:
Tickets Bought Tomorrow(TBT) is a web application where one can see when the most popular events will start selling tickets.  This application was inspired by trying to find out when Hamilton tickets were going on sale.  It's very difficult to find a central location for these dates and there sparked an idea.
